Hi and welcome! I am a Researcher in Petrology and Volcanology at the Department of Physics and Geology, University of Perugia (UNIPG). I focus my researches on the petrological characterization of volcanoes with emphasis on dynamics and time-scales of pre-eruptive events. To do that, I combine classical and unconventional techniques. Since 2002, Iâ€™ve carried out intense laboratory work mainly focused on the development of the Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analytical facility @UNIPG. Currently, I lead the research group @UNIPG, Department of Physics and Geology, for the application of Machine Learning techniques in geology. Also, I am the scientific manager of the LA-ICP-MS laboratory @UNIPG.
