Hi and welcome! I am a Researcher in Petrology and Volcanology at the <a href="http://pvrg.unipg.it">PVRG group</a> at the Department of Physics and Geology, University of Perugia (UNIPG). I focus <a href="https://www.mauriziopetrelli.info/research-teaching">my researches</a> on the petrological characterization of volcanoes with emphasis on dynamics and time-scales of pre-eruptive events. To do that, I combine classical and unconventional techniques. Since 2002, Iâ€™ve carried out intense laboratory work mainly focused on the development of the Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analytical facility @UNIPG. Currently, I lead the research group @UNIPG, Department of Physics and Geology, for the application of Machine Learning techniques in geology. Also, I am the scientific manager of the <a href="http://pvrg.unipg.it/laser-ablation-icp-ms/">LA-ICP-MS laboratory</a> @UNIPG.
